# Clustering-Techniques-Comparison
**K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**

---

## Abstract

This project involves applying three unsupervised machine learning techniques — K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) — on a dataset. The data was preprocessed by handling outliers, encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and scaling numeric features using Robust Scaler to mitigate the effect of outliers.
